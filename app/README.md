## What is Stratego

### Rules of Stratego

All movable pieces, with the exception of the Scout, may move only one step to any adjacent space vertically or horizontally (but not diagonally).
A piece may not move onto a space occupied by a like-color piece.
Bomb and Flag pieces are not moveable.
The Scout may move any number of spaces in a straight line (such as the rook in chess).
In the older versions of Stratego the Scout could not move and strike in the same turn;
in newer versions this was allowed.
Even before that, sanctioned play usually amended the original Scout movement to allow moving and striking in the same turn because it facilitates gameplay.

No piece can move back and forth between the same two spaces for more than three consecutive turns (two square rule), 
nor can a piece endlessly chase a piece it has no hope of capturing (more square rule).

When a player wants to attack, they "strike" by touching an opposing piece with their piece or by moving it onto the square the opposing piece occupies. 
Both players then reveal their piece's rank; the weaker piece (see exceptions below) is removed from the board.
If the engaging pieces are of equal rank, both are removed.
A piece may not move onto a square already occupied unless it attacks. 
The original rules also contained a provision that following a strike, the winning piece immediately occupies the space vacated by the losing piece.

Two pieces have special attack powers. One special piece is the Bomb which only Miners can defuse. 
It immediately eliminates any other piece striking it without being destroyed itself.
Each player also has one Spy, which succeeds only if it attacks the Marshal or the Flag. 
If the Spy attacks any other piece, or is attacked by any piece (including the Marshal), the Spy is defeated.
